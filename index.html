		<p>Hi there! My name is Zhaohui. I am an avid Aviation Geek (Avgeek for short) who loves every machine that flies! I am also a designer who is curious about, and constantly trying to improve the world around me â€” both physical and digital, and to create functional, enjoyable and meaningfully nuanced experiences. and proudly gay.</p>

		<p>I've flown three full-flight simulators: A330
			<img src="images/a330sim.jpg">, Boeing 737<img src="images/b737sim.jpg">, and A350 <img src="images/a350sim.jpg">. But I would love to fly these three amazing aircrafts some day.
