		<h1>Boeing 787</h1>

	</header>

	<main>

		<p>The 787 is something similar to a first love and first sight. <img src='images/b787/boeing-787-dreamliner-delay.jpg.webp'> It's just an unexplicably handsome creation on the outside. And a pleasure to fly on the inside</p>

		<p>Powered by two GENx or Rolls-Royce Trent engines, the 787 is in no short supply of power <img src='images/b787/HtsVp.jpg'> <img src='images/b787/GEnx-Engine-Graphic.jpg'> And its fuselage is made entirely from composite material, making it lighter yet stronger than aircrafts made from aluminium <img src='images/b787/barrell-begun-winding.jpg''></p>

		<p>In the flight deck,the 787 packs teh cutting-edge of flight: <img src='images/b787/cockpit.jpg'> Two flight computers monitor the aircraft's status and make tiny, inperciptable adjustments many times a second to counter gust.</p>
